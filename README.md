## TravelApp

**TravelApp** is a mobile application developed using **React Native** and **Expo** as part of the Mobile App Development Lab. The app allows users to explore different travel destinations and view their details. The application utilizes **React Navigation** for navigating between screens and includes a bottom tab navigator with icons. It also features a stack navigator for detailed views of selected destinations.

The project demonstrates the use of:
- **React Navigation** (for tab and stack navigation)
- **Ionicons** (for tab icons)
- **State Management** (for passing data between screens)
- **FlatList** (for displaying a list of destinations)
- **Custom Styling** (to improve UI/UX)
